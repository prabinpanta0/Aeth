# Makefile for Aeth
#
# This Makefile provides targets for building, installing, uninstalling,
# and managing dependencies for the Aeth Haskell project across various
# Linux distributions.
#
# Usage:
#   make help          - Display this help message.
#   make deps          - Install system-level dependencies (GHC, Cabal) for your distribution.
#   make build         - Build the Aeth project.
#   make install       - Install the Aeth executable to ~/.local/bin (or where cabal puts it).
#   make uninstall     - Uninstall the Aeth executable.
#   make run           - Run the Aeth project.
#   make clean         - Clean build artifacts.

.PHONY: all help deps build install uninstall run clean

# --- Configuration ---
PROJECT_NAME := Aeth
CABAL_EXE_NAME := $(strip Aeth)# As defined in aeth.cabal
INSTALL_DIR := $(strip $(HOME)/.local/bin)# Default installation directory for user binaries

# --- Distribution Detection ---
# Try to detect the distribution using lsb_release or /etc/os-release
DISTRO := $(shell lsb_release -si 2>/dev/null || cat /etc/os-release | grep -E "^ID=" | cut -d'=' -f2 | tr -d '"')
# Convert to lowercase for easier matching
DISTRO := $(shell echo $(DISTRO) | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
